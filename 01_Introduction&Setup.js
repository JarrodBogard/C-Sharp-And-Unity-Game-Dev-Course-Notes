// Lesson 2: Download Unity & VS Code

// Unity is the game engine and vs code is the code editor we use to write the code that is run on the unity game engine.

// Unreal is another popular game engine.
// VS Code is referred to as an IDE (i.e. integrated development environment)

// Relationship between Unity and VS Code:

// Unity is a visual interface for creating games, and it provides systems of existing code that are used for things like physics, rendering, audio, etc.

// VS Code is a place to write code which is what tells the game engine (i.e. Unity) what to do or how to run any given game, and it offers auto-complete, color coding, syntax error checking along with many other tools to help facilitate writing code effectively.
//      - The code that is written in VS Code is saved in scripts, which for C#, are .cs files (i.e. the file extension for C# files is .cs).

// VS Code offers instructions to Unity and Unity follows those instructions and runs the program/game accordingly.
//      - Unity reads the code saved in the scripts (i.e. the .cs files).
